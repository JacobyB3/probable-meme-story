Once upon a time there was a man named Bob. Bob lived in a hut on the
outskirts of a town called "Gibhut"
The town of Gibhut was very large, and every hut looked diferent from 
every other one. Becuase of this, each person, including Bob, was able to make
the hut of their dreams in Gibhut.

One day, Bob was waken from the sleep by a constant knock on his door. "Open up, it's Push".
A sharp voice pierced through the air. "Through the forest of the internet have I came, through
the baptism of encryption have I took. Open up, it was the local directory that sent me here, my Master."


The End.
